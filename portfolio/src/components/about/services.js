        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          Why do I love writing code? It allows me to build a totally customized
          product from the ground-up, using a wide array of tools and
          technologies. Don't settle for average - tell me what you want, and
          I'll make it happen.
        </p>
        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p>
          A website is nothing withouta home, and I offer hosting solutions for
          all of my clients. And since you own all of the code I produce, if you
          ever want to migrate elsewhere, I make it easy.
        </p>
        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>
          Your website needs to be functional, but it also needs to be
          beautiful. Templated solutions are just that - templated - and your
          customers are savvy enough to recognize a pre-built website. I will
          work alongside you to create an elegant, aesthetic website/web app you
          will be proud to show your friends and family.
